# Atkinson Monolegible

An attempt at creating a monospace version of the Braille Institute's Atkinson Hyperlegible font, for code.

Created using [cpitclaudel/monospacifier](https://github.com/cpitclaudel/monospacifier) as a base, with manual modifications on top.

I've been daily driving this font for over a year as my terminal and editor font, and I've been enjoying it.
It's not perfect, but I think it's pretty unique compared to some other monospaced fonts. Occasionally, I go back in and fix up kerning/spacing issues that I've noticed.
